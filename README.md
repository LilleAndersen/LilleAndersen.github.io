This is my personal school website for school and all other potential projects. It was made with the basis of a school assignment. But it has become more than just a school assignment.

### The website has two primary designs:
- The old, cozier and more complicated design: [old.little.yessness.com](https://old.little.yessness.com/)
- The new and improved; simpler and more stylish design: [little.yessness.com](https://little.yessness.com/)

This code is mostly written by me (with help from [soni801](https://github.com/soni801)), but can be used and forked if proper credit is given.
